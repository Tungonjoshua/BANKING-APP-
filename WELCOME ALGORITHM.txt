WELCOME screen ALGORITHM
STEP 1:
Define the main function to handle the initial welcome message and user prompt.
Display a welcome message for the bank.
Wait for the user to press Enter to continue.
Call the banking.py script using subprocess.call.
STEP 2:
Ensure the main function is executed when the script is run directly by using the if __name__ == "__main__": main() construct.

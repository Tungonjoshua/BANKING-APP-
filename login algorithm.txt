login Algorithm
STEP 1:
Define the main function to initiate the login process.
Define the welcome function to call the welcome screen.py script.
STEP 2:
Print a welcome message for the bank login.
Prompt the user to enter their phone number and password.
STEP 3:
Print an "Authenticating..." message to simulate the authentication process.
Placeholder for actual authentication logic (to be implemented later).
STEP 4:
If authentication is successful, call the welcome function to execute the welcome screen.py script.
STEP 5:
Define the __main__ block to call the main function, initiating the login process.
